        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. potatoes</li>
            <li>14 oz. distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbls. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbls. malt vinegar powder</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a mandolin, carefully cut the potatoes into 1/16-inch-thick slices. They should be thin enough to see through. Add the potato slices to a bowl and cover them with the distilled vinegar. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place 2 baking sheets in the oven and heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the kosher salt and malt vinegar powder to a small bowl and mix. Set the mixture aside. </li>
            <li>Remove baking sheets from the oven and arrange potato slices on top in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Remove the potato slices from the vinegar and dry completely. This can be done by arranging the potato slices on clean kitchen towels or paper towels in an even layer, making sure not to overlap them. </li>
            <li>Place the dried potato slices on the baking sheets in a single layer</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are golden on the bottom, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, drizzle with vinegar, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
